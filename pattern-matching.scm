;;;; A Schemely pattern matching facility.

;;; This is an implementation of the idea described in pattern-matching.txt.
;;;
;;; It differs from what is described in that document as follows:
;;;
;;; - Interface: matchers pass the pieces of the object to the win
;;;   continuation, and nothing to the lose continuation.  Since MIT
;;;   Scheme does not do flow analysis, no measures to make it more
;;;   effective are taken.
;;;
;;; - Naming convention: matchers are named after the type name, with
;;;   no typographic markers.  What is called `pair?*' in the text is
;;;   called `pair' here.
;;;
;;; - List matchers, segment variables, and guards are not implemented.
;;;
;;; - As patterns are implemented, with the syntax (pair a d :as foo)
;;;
;;; - Be sure to (declare (integrate-externals "pattern-matching")) in
;;;   any file that uses this, or you will start consing closures like
;;;   mad and probably suffer around 5x-10x slowdown in case* forms.

;;; This matching and destructuring system depends on two main
;;; components: the matcher procedures and the case* macro.  They
;;; conspire to make examples like this (contrived one) work:
;;;
;;;   (case* foo
;;;    ((pair a (pair ad dd)) (+ a ad dd))
;;;    ((pair _ d) d)
;;;    ((null) 3)
;;;
;;; This evaluates foo; if it turns out to be a pair whose cdr is also
;;; a pair, it will (try to) sum the car, cadr, and cddr of foo;
;;; otherwise if it turns out to be pair, will return its cdr;
;;; otherwise if it turns out to be null, will return 3; otherwise
;;; will return an unspecified value.
;;;
;;; The matcher procedures used in the above example are `pair' and
;;; `null'.  A matcher procedure must accept three arguments: the
;;; object to match, a procedure to call if it matches, and a
;;; procedure to call if it does not.  The meaning of matching depends
;;; on the particular matcher procedure; in the case of `pair' that
;;; would be being a pair, and in the case of `null' that would be
;;; being null.  If the object indeed matches, the matcher procedure
;;; must call its second argument with the match data.  What the match
;;; data is is also defined by the particular matcher procedure -- in
;;; the case of `pair', that would be the car and the cdr of the pair,
;;; and in the case of `null', there is no match data (so the second
;;; argument to `null' must accept no arguments).  If the object does
;;; not match, the matcher procedure must call its third argument with
;;; no arguments.
;;;
;;; The provided matcher procedures are:
;;;
;;;   TODO document provided matcher procedures
;;;
;;; You are free and encouraged to write your own.  Defining them with
;;; define-integrable is recommended for performance (as is
;;; appropriate application of integrate-externals in files that use
;;; your custom matcher procedures.
;;;
;;; The case* macro has the following syntax:
;;;
;;; <case*>   = (case* <expr> <clause> ...)
;;; <clause>  = (<pattern> <body-form> ...)
;;;           | (<matcher> => <receiver>)
;;; <pattern> = _
;;;           | <var>
;;;           | (<matcher> <pattern> ...)
;;;           | (<matcher> <pattern> ... :as <var>)
;;;
;;; <matcher>, <receiver>, <expr>, and <body-form> are Scheme
;;; expressions.
;;;
;;; The semantics of a case* form are as follows.  First, the <expr>
;;; is evaluated (once) to produce an object to be matched against.
;;; Then each clause is tried in turn (described below) until one
;;; matches; in which case the value of the case* form is the value
;;; produced by that clause.  If none of the clauses match, the value
;;; of the case* form is unspecified.
;;;
;;; There are two types of clauses: normal pattern clauses and "arrow
;;; clauses", the latter being distinguished by the presence of the
;;; token `=>' in the second position in the clause.  The arrow
;;; clauses are simpler so we describe them first.
;;;
;;; If the clause is an arrow clause, both expressions in the clause
;;; are evaluated.  The first is expected to return a matcher
;;; procedure, as above, and the second is expected to return a
;;; procedure.  The matcher procedure is then called on the object
;;; being matched against, the procedure returned by the receiver
;;; form, and a nullary procedure that, if invoked, will continue
;;; matching later clauses.  The effect is that if the object matches
;;; the matcher, the case* form will reduce to a call to the receiver
;;; with the match data as defined by the matcher; otherwise
;;; evaluation will continue.
;;;
;;; If the clause is a pattern clause, the behavior depends on the
;;; pattern.  If the pattern is a variable, it will automatically
;;; match, and the body of the clause will be evaluated in an
;;; environment where the object is bound to that variable.  The
;;; special variable `_' is treated as an ignore directive, and the
;;; object is not bound in this case.  If the pattern is a list, then
;;; the first element of the pattern is evaluated to produce a matcher
;;; procedure, as above.  This matcher procedure is called on the
;;; object, a procedure constructed from the rest of the pattern
;;; together with the clause body, and a nullary procedure that will
;;; continue by trying the remaining clauses.  If the remaining
;;; elements of the pattern are all variables, then, if the object
;;; matches, the body will be evaluated in an environment where the
;;; match data is bound to those variables (underscores are again
;;; treated as ignore directives).  If any of the elements of the
;;; pattern are nontrivial subpatterns, the corresponding part of the
;;; object will be matched recursively.  If the whole pattern matches,
;;; the body will be evaluated in an environment where all the parts
;;; are bound to the given names; if not, the next clause will be
;;; tried.
;;;
;;; If the second-to-last element of a pattern is the token `:as',
;;; this is an "as-pattern".  The object being matched against this
;;; pattern will be bound to the last element of the pattern (which
;;; must be a variable), and the match will proceed using the pattern
;;; without the `:as' token or that variable.
